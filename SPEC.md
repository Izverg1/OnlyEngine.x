# OnlyEngine.x Tasks and User Journey

## Overview
OnlyEngine.x is a SaaS platform automating hyper-realistic content generation (e.g., feet), ensuring quality, targeting subscribers, and streaming to OnlyFans, Fansly, and FeetFinder. It uses fictional, disclosed AI content legally to reverse creator revenue dips (e.g., 5% MoM). This document outlines your tasks and user journey based on the design as of 10:27 PM EDT, August 31, 2025.
